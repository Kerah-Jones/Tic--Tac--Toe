In this respository I v=created a Tic-Tac-Toe game, meant to play with friends and family. I am sure you will enjoy the user experience. In order to play the game, you must sign in, so please make a account, and enjoy the game.

In this project, in order to sign in, a api on the backend of the application was implemented. I also used a lot of css and html to broaden the user experience. I also used JavaScript to build the game board. My first steps were to get the authorization for the users up and running. The second was the game-board logic, and the thrid was the ui.js to make the page flow in the application while signing in and out.

I am still working on the game stats and the messages of swapping turns to work. Currently only when it is 'O' turn, the message will display.
