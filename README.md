In this respository I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game, meant to play with friends and family. I am sure you will enjoy the user experience. In order to play the game, you must sign in, so please make a account, and enjoy the game.

In this project, in order to sign in, a api on the backend of the application was implemented. I also used a lot of css and html to broaden the user experience. I also used JavaScript to build the logic and functionality of the game board. My first steps were to get the authorization for the users up and running. The second was the game-board logic, and the thrid was the ui.js to make the page flow in the application while signing in and out.

### Future Developement Plans
I am still working on the game stats and the messages of swapping turns to work. Currently only when it is 'O' turn, the message will display.
